###About
Chromolite is a universal desktop application that allows control of RGB WS2812B LED strips. The application offers many customisation options and modes through an easy to use interface.

The Chromolite desktop application is written in the Java based programming language Processing 3. The application controls the LED strips through serial communication to an Arduino micrcontroller operating the Chromolite purpose built program. The Arduino microcontroller program required to interface with the desktop application is written using the C/C++ based Arduino language. In order to interface with the LEDs, some initial set up is required and is detailed in the setup section below.

###Features
* 7 unique modes:
  * <b>Static:</b> Sets the LED strips to a single selected colour.
  * <b>Random:</b> Changes the LED strips to a randomly generated colour at short intervals.
  * <b>Wave:</b> Colours of the spectrum move across the LED strip in a wave-like motion.
  * <b>Music:</b> Reacts to an audio input signal, displaying 3 specified colours.
  * <b>Spectrum:</b> All LEDs gradually cycle through the colour spectrum together.
  * <b>Strobe:</b> Turns all LEDs on and off at a very fast rate to the selected colour.
  * <b>Off:</b> Turns all LEDs off.
* Keyboard shortcut control.
* Spectrum based colour selection.
* Clean and simple user interface.
* Cross platform compatibility (Windows, macOS and Linux).
